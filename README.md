# Gameplay Tag Stacks Plugin

Replicated Gameplay Tags that can be used in a stack-like manner.  
Similar to what [Lyra Starter Game](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/paths/Z4/lyra-starter-game) uses.

Usefull for storing stats (Kills / Assists / Deaths / Ammo / etc. ) that need to be replicated to other clients.
